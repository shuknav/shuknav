### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1720803760/94660/blob-wave-reverse-gif.gif" width="25"/>

I'm Abhinav, a CS grad from India who just spends time making useful things that just work (mostly ðŸ˜…)

Iâ€™m currently building [**SplitSavvy**](https://github.com/shuknav/SplitSavvy), a smart shared-living app that helps roommates split bills, track utilities, and manage onboarding seamlessly.  
Alongside that, I'm also developing [**Savry**](https://github.com/Savry-in) â€” a kitchen inventory manager that recommends meals, tracks spoilage, and automates restocking.

Outside of dev life, I spend my time experimenting in the kitchen, getting lost in books, messing around with music-making, or gaming to recharge and reset.
